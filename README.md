# POWER-BI

A Power BI dashboard is a single page, often called a canvas, that tells a story through visualizations. Because it's limited to one page, a well-designed dashboard contains only the highlights of that story. Readers can view related reports for the details.
Dashboards are a feature of the Power BI service only. They're not available in Power BI Desktop. Although you can't create dashboards on mobile devices, you can view and share them there.

Dashboard basics
The visualizations you see on the dashboard are called tiles. You pin tiles to a dashboard from reports. If you're new to Power BI, you can get a good foundation by reading Basic concepts for designers in the Power BI service.
The visualizations on a dashboard originate from reports and each report is based on a dataset. One way to think of a dashboard is as an entryway to the underlying reports and datasets. Selecting a visualization takes you to the report (and dataset) that it's based on.

Advantages of dashboards
Dashboards are a wonderful way to monitor your business and see all of your most important metrics at a glance. The visualizations on a dashboard can come from one underlying dataset or many, and from one underlying report or many. A dashboard combines on-premises and cloud data, providing a consolidated view regardless of where the data lives.

A dashboard isn't just a pretty picture. It's highly interactive and the tiles update as the underlying data changes.

Who can create a dashboard?
The ability to create a dashboard is considered a creator feature and requires edit permissions on the report. Edit permissions are available to report creators and to those colleagues the creator grants access. For example, if David creates a report in workspace ABC and adds you as a member of that workspace, you and David both have edit permissions. On the other hand, if a report has been shared with you directly or as part of a Power BI app, you're consuming the report. You may not be able to pin tiles to a dashboard.
